# Anthony Ouzhene | Developer Backend ðŸ’»ðŸ‘‹ðŸš€

Hello, I'm a french web developer. I made different works throughout my life as project manager or a gateaway transit agent.
Finally, I live my passion in the numeric world with my skills as a web developper backend / WordPress & a freelance SEO writer.
The art of coding opens a lot of way to express myself. I will go on to find out more technologies to open my wings and fly away !
