# Anthony Ouzhene | Fullstack - Backend developer ðŸ’»ðŸ‘‹ðŸš€

Hello, I'm a french web developer. I made different works throughout my life as project manager, gateaway transit agent or even SEO freelance writer.
I was formed to become a fullstack developper but I totally have fun in progressing as a backend Dev.

I particularly like using the (cocorico) french framework Symfony. Rencently, I discovered the CMS Drupal which combines WordPress & Symfony. I'm looking forward to go deep into this new discovery.
