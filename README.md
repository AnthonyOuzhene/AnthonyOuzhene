# Anthony Ouzhene | Fullstack / Backend developer ðŸ’»ðŸ‘‹ðŸš€

Hello, I'm a french web developer. I made different works throughout my life as project manager or a gateaway transit agent.
Finally, I live my passion in the numeric world with my skills as a web developper fullstack & a freelancer SEO writer.

The art of coding opens a lot of way to express myself. I will go on to find out more technologies to spread my wings and fly away !
